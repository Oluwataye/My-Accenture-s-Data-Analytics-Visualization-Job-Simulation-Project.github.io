									<img src="images/Project recap.png" alt="Project Recap">
									<div style="text-align:left;">
										<p>To kick things off let me recap this engagement.
										</p>
										<p>We, Accenture have embarked on a 3 month pilot with Social Buzz to focus on
											3 main tasks, aligned with some of the biggest challenges that you're currently
											facing.
										</p>
										<p>Social Buzz has reached huge scale in recent years to become recognized as a
											global unicorn company. We are here to help you manage this scale and to
											guide you in the right direction.
										</p>
										<p>Firstly, we will be doing an audit of your big data practice and sharing best
											practices and industry expertise. Secondly we will be guiding you through a
											successful IPO, of which we have deep expertise and knowledge of within our
											team. And finally, we have conducted an analysis of your data to find insights
											regarding your top 5 most popular categories of content
										</p>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Data sets - Quick Explanation:</h3><hr>
									<ol style="text-align:left;">
										<li>Identify the best data sets needed for the analysis from data tables the client has sent through:
											<ul>
												<li>7 data sets - each data set contains different columns and values</li>
												<li>A data model - this shows the relationships between all of the data sets, as well as any links that you can use to merge tables.
													There is a lot of information here and it’s easy to get lost in the data. So, to make sure you are using the right data to answer the business questions you’ll follow these steps:
												</li>
												<ol>
													<li>Requirements gathering</li>
													<li>Data cleaning</li>
													<li>Data modelling</li>
												</ol>	
											</ul>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Problem</h3><hr>
									<img src="images/Problem.png" alt="Problem">
									<div style="text-align:left;"><p>Focusing on the last point that I mentioned there, this is what the Data Analytics
										team has been specifically focused on.
										Clearly with such grand scale, this comes with a lot of data and with such vast
										amounts of data comes challenges.
									</p>
										To give a background on how much data you've been creating:
										<ul>
											<li>You told us that your platform receives over 100000 posts per day which
												amounts to 36 500 000 posts every year, of which, this is all unstructured data
												making it very hard to make sense of.
											</li>
										</ul>
									<p>In this day and age, content is king. Just look at some of the biggest platforms
										in the world, for example YouTube, Facebook and Netflix... they are all content
										businesses...
									</p>
									<p>But how to capitalize on it when there is so much?
									</p>
									<p>It's not just all about harvesting as much content as possible... The real value is
										in understanding and crunching this content to gain a deeper understanding of
										your audience and to therefore provide a more personalized and enjoyable
										experience.
									</p>
									<p>And this is where out data analytics expertise comes in, with the insights that
										we've uncovered from this task, we can show you exactly how to take analytics
										to production at scale.
									</p>
									</div>	

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Analytics Team</h3><hr>
									<img src="images/Team.png" alt="Team">
									<div style="text-align:left;">
									<p>Talking about experience, we have a large data analytics practice at Accenture
										but we had a team of 3 people primarily focusing on this task. Andrew Fleming
										is our Chief Technical Architect and his expertise really helped to guide the
										team to produce high quality analysis.
									</p>
									<p>Marcus Rompton, a senior principal has worked with the worlds biggest clients
										on solving their data problems and was heavily involved in the data engineering
										side of this project.
									</p>
									<p>And finally myself, Taye David Ibukun, who was solely responsible for taking leadership
										guidance and delivering high quality insights from the raw datasets and turning
										these into business decisions.
									</p>
									</div>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Process</h3><hr>
									<img src="images/Process.png" alt="Process">
									<p style="text-align:left;">So, how did we tackle this problem?
									Well we approached it in 5 steps:
									<ol style="text-align:left;">
										<li>Data understanding - the key to success on any data project is to understand
												the data in detail. So we took the time to understand the data model and
												domain of your business.
										</li>
										<li>Data cleaning - after understanding your business, we then cleaned the
												available datasets and thought about what an ideal dataset should look like for
												this problem.
										</li>
										<li>Data modelling - After ensuring the data was clean for analysis, we needed
												to process and model this data into a dataset that can precisely answer the
												business questions and produce the results needed.
										</li>
										<li>Data analysis - With our new dataset, we used our analytical expertise to
												uncover insights from this dataset and to produce visualizations to describe the
												insights.
										</li>
										<li>And finally we used these insights to unlock business decisions and to make
												recommendations on next steps.
										</li>
									</ol>
									</p>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Insights</h3><hr>
									<img src="images/Insights.png" alt="Insights">
									<div style="text-align:left;">
									<p>From your data we found that you had a total of 16 unique categories of posts
										across your sample dataset. This includes things such as Food, Science and
										Animals.
									</p>
									<p>As well as this, there were 1897 reactions from just the animal category alone!
										People obviously really like animals!
									</p>
									<p>And also the most common month for users to post within was January. This
										aligns with seasonal trends of social media users that feel the need to
										reconnect with people after calendar events such as Christmas.
									</p>
									<p>But now, onto the main question... which is... what were the top 5 most popular
										categories of posts?
									</p>
									</div>
									<img src="images/Insights2.png" alt="Insights2">
									<div><p>From our analysis, you can see that the top 5 most popular categories of posts
										were animals, science, healthy eating, technology and food in descending
										order.
									</p>
									<p>Animals had an aggregate popularity score of around 74965. It is very
										interesting to see both food and healthy eating within the top 5, it really shows
										that food is a highly engaging content category. Healthy eating ranks slightly
										higher than food, so perhaps your user base may be skewed towards healthy
										eaters and health-conscious people.
									</p>
									<p>Finally, its also interesting to see science and technology too. This may suggest
										that people enjoy consuming factual content and snippets of content that they
										can learn something from.
									</p>
									</div>
									<img src="images/Insights3.png" alt="Insights3">
									<div style="text-align:left;">
									<p>Additionally, you can see from this chart the % split of popularity between the
										top 5 categories. There is not much difference between the share of each
										category, however, the difference between the 1st most popular, animals and
										the 2nd most popular, science, is the largest gap equal to 1.1%.	
									</p>
									<p>In business terms, this could suggest that the most popular category, animals,
										is tailing away from the rest of the categories and may continue to get more and
										more popular. To avoid an issue where 1 content category consumes the entire
										platform, it will be important for you to ensure that any algorithms used to
										govern the content on the platform gives a fair balance to the content
										categories.
									</p>
									</div>

									<h3 style="text-align:left;">Summary</h3><hr>
									<img src="images/Summary.png" alt="Summary">
									<div style="text-align:left;">
									<p style="text-align:left;">So to summarize:
										We tackled this task and found the top 5 most popular categories as asked, but
										we also went one step further.
									</p>
									<ul style="text-align:left;">
										<li>We found that animals and science are the two most popular categories,
											suggesting that users like "real-life" and "factual" content
										</li>
										<li>We also found that food was a common theme amongst popular content and
											the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to
											show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this
											insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a
											campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating
											brands to promote content.
										</li>
										<li>As much as this analysis was insightful, we are ready to take it to the next
											stage and we have the expertise within Accenture to help you realize these
											kinds of insights in production across your organization and in real-time. We
											would love to help you with this.
